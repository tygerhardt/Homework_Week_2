              <p class="card-text">I have been an active professional to semi-professional musician for 36 years. I play guitar, bass, and drums. I've been known to peck a mean synth and I played sax and cello in high school and college. Currently I play bass in Portland's Panthervision and I'm developing a guitar project with my wife called Prayer Closet.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I love French bulldogs. These three were my life. Coco (middle) died unexpectedly shortly after my wife of 17 years came out to me. When she moved on to her new life she took Coco's littermate, Jackson and our adopted boy Dylan with her...and then she ghosted me. It still hurts more than I can say.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I enjoy writing. I've self-published two poetry collections entitled, "The 12-Step Son" and "Tales from the Brick Shithouse" which paid for my move to Berkeley back in '95. I've worked for Monster Cable as a copywriter and I've freelanced for Guitar Player and Bass Player magazines. Currently I'm working on my biography entitled, "The Clawfoot Womb". My work, like my life, is mostly dark satire.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I don't drive a car. I don't really care for it. To quote one of my favorite films, "The more you drive, the less intelligent you become". I don't disagree. I used to take public transit until I got held up at gunpoint one afternoon coming home from the BART station. That's when a friend introduced me to motorcycle riding. I've been hooked ever since...and I haven't been robbed. Coincidence? Probably.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">TECHNOLOGY</h5>
              <p class="card-text">I have always been fascinated with technology. My family was poor. When I was 7 I used to go dumpster diving. Sometimes I would find old radios that were broken and thrown out and fix them. Many things were broken in my life at the time so there was an impetus to fix things. That combined with my intellectual curiousity (and my ability to occasionally take a charge off a capacitor without dying) was the beginning of my love of tech.</p>

              <p class="card-text">My wife is a proud and talented trans woman. She is a local musician, writer, comedian, and drag performer with a residency at the Clinton Street theater and a participant in The Last Laugh drag comedy competition. I do all of her audio and video work and occasionally perform in her bits under the name Popper John. While I don't do it often, I have been inspired to start producing my own pieces based on my life...just waiting for the softpocalypse to end.</p>
